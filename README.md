#A smater home, a smater you!!!

This is the code for the wifi smart house project created at **BMSHackIT**. This project features the spark core a **IoT** based IC, which enables you to create a smart house with an *artificial intelligence*, to control all of the **IoT ICs** which are embedded with your everyday household electronics.
Each spark core is mounted randomly or in accordance with the users, to respond to day to day activities like to turn your house lights in a notification alarm for your emails, or you can get an email when your washing machine completes a wash cycle.
Further use of or the more complicated uses include the lights turning on when you enter your house and you can see who is being spying on your room in your absence.

##Here is How it works
Let's say you come home and have an active wifi network at your house (At least most of the people do), and your smart phone connects to it. This could be an easy way to tell that you are back into your house, your phone tells the server your back and you get a report of the people who were in your house, and your coffee maker makes you a cup of coffee and maybe some friendly music to calm you down (I can tell that my day would go great).

Lets say that you have an elderly person in your house or living just a couple of blocks away, and he has a problem of sleep walking or maybe has some temperature. Lets help your family out by giving him IoT, here is how it goes, lets say its 1am and he wakes to another day of sleep walking. You would get notified on your smart phone or your alarm may turn on warning you off this, and you don't have to turn on your lights to put him back to bed, IoT will help you around.

##Ok, here is some technical specifications, of the things used.
The ICs used are the *Spark Core or an Arduino (alternative)*, the spark core is a IoT based IC, and is extremely small just about the size of an Arduino nano.
All of the ICs are connected to a *IFTTT server*, which has a great graphical UI and easy to use.
A few custom android apps to help you along the way.

##Project on the way
With the help of the IoT we can measure **heart rates** and can send the recorded data to your *server or a cloud*. From this doctor could analyse the heart rates and could perform the necessary procedures.

##Future Projects
With the help of it, why not graph a reading of your **alpha brain waves** and you can maybe send emails, turn on lights, coffee makers, browse through your TV, etc.
